----------
	added 'crusde -p install <plugin.so>' which is used in install_plugins.sh
		This is the new way to fill $CRUSDE_HOME/plugins/plugins.xml with the plugins that come 
		with the standard distribution. 
		
		install_plugins.sh is a tcsh script which contains lists of the standard plugins in the 
		order necessary to meet all dependencies. For each plugin
	
			crusde -p install <plugin.so>

		is called which uses the the same functionality the existing GUI based PluginManager uses to test 
		the plugins and add them to the database, only that the GUI is not started. 

		- SimulationCore has installPlugin(string) added 
		- InputHandler has the respective checking added -- does not work with multiple options, yet!!

2009-07-11
----------
	added possibility to allow for optional parameters:
		- crusde-API expanded by crusde_register_optional_param* functions which ask for a default value for this parameter
		- ParamWrapper carries flag 'optional' which is set by the registration functions
		- InputHandler checks for this flag when going through the list of non-initialized (in XML file) params.
	added info.h
		- contains the existing usage() function, called in InputHandler.
		- contains new version() function, that gives ... tadaaa ... version information. (add retrieval of SVN revision number!)

	added output functions to API for plugins that are also used internally, all work like printf:
		- crusde_info(message, ...): writes message to stdout
		- crusde_warning(message, ...): writes warning message to stderr
		- crusde_error(message, ...): writes error message to stderr and terminates CrusDe
		- crusde_debug(message, ...): writes debug message to stderr if compiled with -DDEBUG

	added 'quiet' commandline option: -q/-Q
		- shuts info messages off, errors and warnings are still displayed, as well as debugging messages.

Changelog v 0.1 - 0.2

1) All code related to model building from commandline deleted

	This affects:	- InputHandler.*pp

2) The tag <load_function> is replaced by <load> and now used to wrap a load and a load history

3) 	- class LoadFunction is introduced to allow for multiple loads with independent histories
	- setHistoryFunction in load plug-ins mandatory


Notes:
	If more than one of the single tags is given in model files, the first one will be taken
